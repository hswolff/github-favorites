GitHub Favorites
====

Do you like GitHub?  Do you like following repos?  Is your GitHub stream noisy from highly active repos?  Then this Chrome Extension is for you!

This little extension for Google Chrome adds a **Favorite** button right next to the **Watch** button.  When you hit that button it adds that repo to the folder 'GitHub Favorites' in your Bookmarks.  If you want to remove the bookmark just hit the **Favorite** button again!

Simple, easy, clean, fun!

This was a weekend project that bled into the week.  Why did it take so long?  Life got in the way.  Damn you life!  Welcome Chrome Extension!

Hope you enjoy =)
